# Lab1 – HCS12 Assembler LED Test

These are the files for the first lab in the modul "Computerarchitektur" (Hochschule Esslingen).

# Preparation Task 1.2
Instead of just using the code of the preparation task 1.1 there were made some major changes regarding task 1.2. These changes happened upon pointing out that the code can be made much slimmer, from another student, with using HCS12 language specific commands.

# Formatting and comments
Please note that the formatting and some comments were done by a LLM to save time.
